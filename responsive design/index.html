                its seat
                cost by 30% to democratize air travel.</p>

                <h3>Boeing vs Airbus</h3>
                <p>The biggest difference between a Boeing and an Airbus cockpit is that the Boeing uses a conventional
                    yoke, and Airbus uses a side stick. According to Airbus, the side stick makes it easier to fly the
                    aircraft because, with
                    armrests correctly set, only very fine wrist movements are required to maneuver the aircraft.</p>
